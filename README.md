This project instructs you how to create an account to github.

The instructions happen to also be the example blog you start with!

[Check out the blog here](https://weshineforjesus.github.io/build-a-blog/).

The default theme comes from [Barry Clark's Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
